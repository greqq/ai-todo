## 💡 Why This Is Amazing

### Current Onboarding (Basic)
```
Q: What's your goal?
A: Become a DevOps Engineer

Q: When?
A: 12 months

[Create 1 goal, done]
```

### New Onboarding (Life Reset Guide)
```

- Your current life (work, energy, satisfaction)
- What you want to avoid (past frustrations)
- What you want to achieve (vision)
- Multiple timeframes (5-10 years down to this month)
- Obstacles and support needs

AI generates:
- Vision statement
- 3-5 balanced goals (Career 50%, Health 25%, Reading 15%, Side project 10%)
- Each goal broken down: 12mo → 6mo → 3mo → monthly → weekly
- Morning routine: Wake, walk, review goals, deep work
- Evening routine: Reflect, plan, read, wind down
- First week action plan with quick wins

Result: Complete life reset plan, not just a TODO list
